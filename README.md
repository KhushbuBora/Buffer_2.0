#Objective of the Project:
	To manage covid-19 vaccination system, where the eligible citizen can register for vaccination and be allotted his/her unique id and vaccination day.

#Functionalities:
1.Registration of citizens for vaccination.
2.Check whether he/she is eligible for vaccination.
3.Assigned priority based on whether its his/her first/second dose, he/she is frontline worker, age, any serious medical condition and have covid history.

#Features:
	This application correctly prioritizes citizens who should be vaccinated first and displays a list of in what sequence and on which day registered citizens would be vaccinated.

#Data Structure used:
	Weâ€™ve used a priority queue implemented using a comparator.
It is the most suitable data structure for arranging citizens in order of their priority. Also the comparator made it easy to assign priority.

#Future Scope:
1.This application can be extended further to be implemented for multiple covid centres of different regions.
2.As we know, the government is modifying vaccination eligibility parameters, all changes can be implemented in this project simply playing around comparators.
3.If connected to the database module, can be applied for much larger no. of (users) citizens.
4.This module can be used in any other system where registrations are to be done on the basis of priority (e.g. hospital) just by modifying some input parameters and comparator.
